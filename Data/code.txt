Here is a simple Python program that generates a random code:

```
import random
import string

def generate_code(length):
    letters = string.ascii_letters
    digits = string.digits
    punctuation = string.punctuation
    all_characters = letters + digits + punctuation

    code = ''.join(random.choice(all_characters) for _ in range(length))
    return code

length = int(input("Enter the length of the code: "))
print("Generated code: ", generate_code(length))
```

This program will ask you to input the length of the code you want to generate. It will then generate a random code of that length using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks.

For example, if you input 8, the program might generate a code like "G8d!e4P".

Let me know if you have any other requests or if you'd like me to write something else for you!
