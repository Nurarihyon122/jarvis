Please provide the English text you'd like me to translate into Hindi. I'll do my best to provide an accurate and natural-sounding translation.

Here's a simple format to follow:

English text:
______________what is it
_______________________________________

And I'll get started on the translation!

(Note: Please note that Hindi is written in the Devanagari script, so I'll provide the translation in Romanization format. If you need the translation in actual Devanagari script, please let me know!)
