 : ipl score of all teams
Sunday : Based on the search results, I can provide you with the information available. However, it seems that there isn't a single page that displays the current scores of all teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). 
But, I can suggest some alternatives:
You can visit the official IPL website, IPLT20.com, which has a points table that displays the current standings of all teams. The website also provides access to match scores, videos, and exclusive content.
Additionally, you can check the IPL Points Table 2025 on Hindustan Times, which provides an update on the current standings of teams in the ongoing season.
If you're looking for the highest totals scored by teams in IPL history, you can refer to the ESPNcricinfo page, which lists the top scores achieved by teams in the tournament.
Please let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification!
